## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of VibeStream up and running for development.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v18 or newer) and **npm**
*   **Python** (v3.11 or newer)
*   A free **Supabase** account
*   A **Google Cloud Platform** account to set up OAuth credentials

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fauzananam/vibestream.git
    cd vibestream
    ```

2.  **Setup Supabase**
    *   Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    *   Navigate to the **SQL Editor** and run all the SQL scripts created during the project to set up tables (`profiles`, `music`, `playlists`), triggers, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
    *   Navigate to **Storage** and create a new **public** bucket named `vibe-storage`. Set up the access policies as defined in the project steps.

3.  **Setup Google OAuth**
    *   Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project.
    *   Navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**, configure it for **External** users, and add the required app information.
    *   Go to **Credentials**, create a new **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** for a **Web application**.
    *   Add your Supabase callback URL to the "Authorized redirect URIs". You can find this URL in your Supabase project under **Authentication > Providers > Google**.
    *   Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    *   In your Supabase project, go to **Authentication > Providers > Google**, enable it, and paste your Client ID and Secret.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    *   In the `backend/` folder, create a `.env` file and add your Supabase credentials:
        ```env
        # backend/.env
        SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
        ```
    *   In the `frontend/` folder, create a `.env.local` file:
        ```env
        # frontend/.env.local
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
        ```

5.  **Run the Project Setup Script**
    This script will create a Python virtual environment and install all required backend and frontend dependencies.
    ```bash
    chmod +x startproject.sh
    ./startproject.sh
    ```

6.  **Set Your Role to Owner**
    To access the Admin Panel, you must manually set your role.
    *   Sign up for your application using Google login.
    *   Go to your Supabase **Table Editor**, open the `profiles` table.
    *   Find the row corresponding to your user and change the value in the `role` column from `user` to `owner`.

7.  **Run the Development Servers**
    This will start both the Python backend and the React frontend concurrently.
    ```bash
    chmod +x startdev.sh
    ./startdev.sh
    ```
    *   Backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
    *   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
